# Sentiment Analysis

Welcome to the **Sentiment Analysis** repository! This project focuses on building a machine learning model to analyze and classify text data based on the sentiment it conveys (positive, negative, or neutral). It is designed to help understand public opinion, customer feedback, or any other textual sentiment data.

## Introduction
Sentiment Analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task used to identify and classify sentiments expressed in text. This repository implements various techniques, from basic machine learning models to advanced deep learning approaches, to achieve accurate sentiment classification.

## Features
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, etc.)
- Multiple model implementations:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT)
- Support for custom datasets
- Evaluation metrics for performance analysis

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Preprocess your dataset by running the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input data/raw_data.csv --output data/cleaned_data.csv
   ```
2. Train a model using your preprocessed data:
   ```bash
   python train.py --model logistic_regression --data data/cleaned_data.csv
   ```
3. Evaluate the trained model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model logistic_regression
   ```
4. Use the model for predictions:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input "I love this product!"
   ```

## Workflow
The general workflow for this project includes:
1. Data Collection: Collect or provide a dataset for analysis.
2. Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the text data.
3. Model Training: Train one or more models on the dataset.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using test data.
5. Deployment: Use the trained model for sentiment predictions.
